Integration
Make sure that the db_manager.py script is executed at least once to set up the database before starting your API server.
Place both scripts in the same project folder, or adjust the import statement in the api_server.py script to correctly locate the db_manager.py.
Ensure all dependencies (e.g., FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, uvicorn) are installed in your environment.
Running Your API Server

Start the API server using python api_server.py to begin accepting requests.
